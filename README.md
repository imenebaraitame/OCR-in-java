# OCR in Java

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/from-referrer/)

## _General Info_
Simple OCR project created with Java to read text from image.

## _Installation_ & Environment variables
To create a simple ocr software, download the tesseract library and install it from [github](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki).
You'll then need to install tesseract in a local directory, default path:
```
.\Tesseract-OCR\tessdata
```
You must define `TESSDATA_PREFIX` in your environment variables.

and then install [image magick](https://imagemagick.org/) to make some adjustments to the image, and help tesseract to improve text recognition.
The default path:
```
.\ImageMagick-7.1.0-Q16-HDRI
```
So lets beging by creating a new maven project and add in pom.xml four dependecies. The first for tesseract library, the 
seconde for creating a pdf document using iText and third one for pdfbox, the last one is for image magick library.

```bash 
 <dependency>
    <groupId>net.sourceforge.tess4j</groupId>
    <artifactId>tess4j</artifactId>
    <version>4.5.4</version>
 </dependency>
```
```bash 
 <dependency>
    <groupId>com.itextpdf</groupId>
    <artifactId>itextpdf</artifactId>
    <version>5.5.13.2 </version>
 </dependency>
``` 
```bash 
 <dependency>
       <groupId>org.apache.pdfbox</groupId>
       <artifactId>pdfbox</artifactId>
       <version>2.0.24</version>
    </dependency>
```    
```bash 
 <dependency>
       <groupId>org.im4java</groupId>
       <artifactId>im4java</artifactId>
       <version>1.4.0</version>
 </dependency> 
```
## _About the code_
The source code is written in 6 classes:
```
  - src
   |
   - main
    |
    - java
     |
     - ocr
      |     
      - Main.java
      - ImgProcess.java
      - Imgtext.java
      - TextPdf.java
      - TesseractCmd.java
      - GetImageLoactionAndSize.java
      - Utils.java
    - resources
     |
     - images
      - ...
```

#
The code is relatively simple, we first open picture in which we are interested in. and we use some digital image processing:
 
 + Deskew: (rotation of the image) This means deskewing the image, to bring it in the right format and right shape.
 + remove black border around the image produce from deskewing the image (previous step).
 + Remove background from the image: make the image transparent in two steps, first we have to make background balck and text white (binarize inverse) and in second we combine this image with the originale to have transparent image .
#
 After that we jump to Imgtext.java class, we are creating a new instance of tesseract. we indicate where we have installed
 the library and then we do a text recognition using the doOCR() method.
#
 And then add this text to Pdf document created from scratch based on iText.

#
The last thing left is creating a searchable pdf with invisible text layer place on the top of the image.
